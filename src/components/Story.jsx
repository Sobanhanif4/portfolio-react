      <p>
        My journey as a front-end developer started back in 2010, working as a <a href="#">freelancer</a> for clients all over the world for several years.
      </p>
      <p>
        After being on my own for a while, I decided to enter the corporate world, and I started working as a software developer at <a href="#">Webflow</a>, the same platform I was using with my freelance clients.
      </p>
      <p>
        After some exciting months of work at Webflow, I decided to transition to <a href="#">Stripe</a>, where I returned to what I love: front-end development.
      </p>
      <p>
        My <a href="#">success</a> quickly compounded, and I started receiving job offers from the biggest names in the industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        All these opportunities led me to travel the world. Eventually, however, I decided to settle down for a more calm and simple routine, and now I'm working at Apple. And you know what? I love what I do! ðŸ’œ
