      <p>
        My journey as a front-end developer is fueled by a passion for creativity and problem-solving. As a <a href="#">BS Software Engineering student</a>, I have dedicated myself to building a strong foundation in programming and design, blending theoretical knowledge with hands-on experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        It all began with my fascination for creating user-friendly and visually appealing web applications. Along the way, I explored <a href="#">React.js</a>, <a href="#">JavaScript</a>, and <a href="#">Chakra UI</a>, which allowed me to bring ideas to life in dynamic and interactive ways. Working with tools like <a href="#">Shopify</a> and <a href="#">WordPress</a> has broadened my perspective, exposing me to real-world client needs and solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I thrive on continuous learning, whether it's developing my own projects, like a <a href="#">Facebook clone</a> or a <a href="#">Pakistan map game</a>, or contributing to collaborative efforts. Balancing my studies and professional aspirations, Iâ€™ve embraced every opportunity to learn from seniors, tackle challenges, and grow as a developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, I aim to take a broader approach to technology, embracing the flexibility to work across stacks while focusing on innovation and efficiency. With every project, I strive to create meaningful digital experiences that leave a lasting impact.
